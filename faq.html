                  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                  <dl>
                    <dt>What do I need to get started renting?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>It's a fairly simple process, but you will need to keep in mind a few things so it all runs smoothly:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You must be 18 years or older (or accompanied by a parent or guardian) to rent</li>
                            <li>A valid ID or credit card</li>
                            <li>We do not accept reservations and all rentals are first-come, first-serve</li>
                        </ul>
                    </dd>  
                    <dt>What if something breaks while I'm renting it?</dt>
                    <dd>
                      <p>Not to worry. We know part of exploring the outdoors is that it's tough on gear. Normal wear and tear is expected and you there's no penalty for that. Product defects and broken fasteners and the like are also part of that normal wear and tear. Intentional harm to products, however, will incure a penalty. This is will depend on the severity.</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>What if I can't get back to return items during business hours?</dt>

                    <dd>
                      <p>Don't worry! Sometimes it's tough to get back into town at the time you were expecting. We have late-night drop off boxes set up outside our store for anytime before or after business hours. However, if we are open, we ask that you come inside to return gear.</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>What if I fall in love with the item I'm renting? Can I buy it from you?</dt>

                    <dd>
                      <p>Whether youâ€™re skiing, snowboarding, climbing, or backpacking our rental program can make it a budget-friendly process. With our rent to own program you can ease your way into buying new equipment and earn discounts on that equipment at the same time!</p>

                        <p>Did you rent or demo skis a few times, or crampons, an avalanche transceiver, maybe a tent? Whatever you took out, you can apply two 2-night rental rates off the price of that item when you buy it from us. Just another way the Mountain Shop is helping you get out more for less!</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>How often do you update your selection?</dt>

                    <dd>
                      <p>We update our entire selection every couple years, and more depending on wear. We pride ourselves on staying up-to-date with the best technologies and updates in the industry.</p>
