            <blockquote>Give a detailed summary of the Home page of the site. Who do you think this site is targeted at? What do you think the demographic for this site is (be as specific as possible)? What do you think the purpose of the site is? Do not click through to anything else on the site. Just review the Home page as it is.</blockquote>
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>The site seems to be targeted towards males and females, ages ranging from 18 - 60 years old. It's marketed towards people who love to run or people looking to get into running. It advertises a lot of community information and support as well as current news and events. At the bottom there is helpful contect information (location and contact numbers) as well as social media links. This page seems to be primarily directed towards current events and information and updates about the running community as a whole.</p>
            
            <h2 id="script2">Scenario 2</h2>
            <blockquote>You are interested in purchasing a pair of Women's Brooks Transcend 3 shoes in size 8 medium. Do not use the Search feature. After you have located the item, please detail whether there was enough information about the product to make you feel confident about the purchase. Summarize the process of finding the product.</blockquote>
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>From the home page, I navigated to the 'shop now' link and clicked on the 'women's shoes' drop-down link. It leads me to a page that looks quite a bit different than the home page. they have links for subcategories, and I clicked on the 'Brooks' brand. The Broks Transcend 3 shoes were on page 2 of the products, and I clicked on them. There is one image with a hover zoom option. I would prefer that there were multiple images from different angles. The description is short and doesn't have much information on specifications. To purchase these I would definitely need more information. As it is, I would need to already be familiar with the shoe (ie. seen them in-person before) to feel comfortable making a purchase.</p>
            
            <h2 id="script3">Scenario 3</h2>
            <blockquote>You are going to train for a marathon and want to find out whether the site provides any training information or opportunities. Locate as many training opportunities as you can and then report on what you found. Include the process of finding it and the quality of information that you found.</blockquote>
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>From the shoe page, I tried to navigated back to the Home screen (it was disconcerting that is was on the right side of the navigation bar instead of the usual left), but it just takes me back to the shop home screen. I had to retype the web address to get back to the page we started on (very annoying). Back at the home page, I navigated to 'Running Resources > Training Advice'. It was a blog-style page with lots of advice, but nothing specific on marathons. I tried 'Running Resources > Personal Coaching' but that wasn't what I wanted either. I found some great trails for training under 'Running Routes > Trails' that could certainly be useful. The 'Group Runs' page was useful for finding infomration on the latest scheduled running groups. Overall, the information was kind of helpful, but I would really like a page about training for a marathon or page that has links to good training schedules or something similar.</p>
