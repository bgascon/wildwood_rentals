                <h1>Backpacking 101</h1>
                
                <p>We know that taking your first backpacking trip can be intimidating. That's why we've put together this handy list to help you plan and outfit your trip. When you decide to leave the campground behind and make the leap to the backcountry, there is a lot to consider. My first backpack was a hand-me-down Gregory and it took me years to accumulate the necessary gear to support me in the wilderness as a bona-fide backpacker.</p>

                <p>Loading up your pack, leaving the car far behind, and carrying everything you need on your back combine to raise the stakes from your standard day hike or car camping overnight. But with a little planning and preparation, you’ll be set for some of the most memorable outdoor experiences of your life.</p>
                
                <h2 id="packing">What to Bring</h2>
                
                <p>First off, you'll need a backpack. Don't have one? Here's a great video that will give you an overview of the types and sizes of backpacking bags:</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Other than your bag, what you carry in your pack will be determined by where you go, what activities you plan to do and what kind of weather you’ll likely encounter. But no matter what the variables, you’re almost certain to be carrying/wearing these items:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Pack Stove, Fuel, and Pots</li>
                    <li>Water Filter and Hydration Pack</li>
                    <li>Tent or Hammock shelter</li>
                    <li>Sleeping Pad</li>
                    <li>Sleeping Bag</li>
                    <li>First Aid Kit</li>
                    <li>Headlamp</li>
                    <li>Clothing that layers well and packs small</li>
                    <li>Rain Gear</li>
                    <li>And many more..</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <h2 id="food">What to Eat</h2>
                
                <p>Planning the meals for your trip is all about packing enough calories to fuel your high-output days without toting a ton of extra weight in your pack. Whether you choose to purchase pre-made dehydrated meals that come in a bag or assemble your own, create a meal plan for each day of your trip.</p>
                
                <p>A gallon of water weighs more than eight pounds, so one of the easiest ways to cut a good chunk of weight from your pack is to dehydrate your food. Pasta sauces, vegetables, chunks of fruit, and mushrooms can all be dried in a home dehydrator and reconstituted in camp. Choose meals with dry base ingredients such as oatmeal, couscous, or rice. But even as you’re trying to save weight, don’t sacrifice the little extras (like a block of cheese, hot sauce, a few fresh veggies, or a chocolate bar) that will help elevate the standard camp meal.</p>
                
                <p>Once you’ve assembled your food, remove any ingredients from bulky packaging and separate them out for each meal in a zip-top bag. Label them Breakfast #2, Dinner #4, etc. This will help avoid a yard sale once you’re in camp and will help keep your food bag or bear canister organized.</p>

                    <h2>Expert Tip #1</h2>
                    <p>Take a car camping trip, short overnight trip, or even just camp out in your backyard for a night with the gear you plan to use. Becoming familiar with your gear and making sure it works properly before you leave can save you big problems on the trail.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Expert Tip #2</h2>
                    <p>Strapping on a 50-pound pack and walking eight miles in a brand new pair of hiking boots can turn into a blistery nightmare. Wear your hiking shoes or boots on short day hikes or even to work to help break them in.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Expert Tip #3</h2>
                    <p>Hitting the trail equipped with a good first aid kit, fire-starting materials, and some basic first aid knowledge will safeguard you from most minor mishaps. Know how to start a fire, where to collect water, and how to build a basic shelter. Take a basic first aid course or, even better, become a Wilderness First Responder (WFR).</p>
